This project created a calendar displaying upcoming events for a theater, as well as highlighting the current date.

It introduced me to using conditional statements, arrays, and loops to create a calendar that displays dates for events, as well as highlighting the current date.
I found formatting the calendar difficult but found highlighting the current date easy.
