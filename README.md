# calendar
This project was made using replit.com. The link to this project on Replit is: https://replit.com/join/fatxyjud-ethanwisdom

This project introduced using conditional statements, arrays, and loops to create a calendar that displays dates for events, as well as highlighting the current date.
I found formatting the calendar difficult but found highlighting the current date easy.
